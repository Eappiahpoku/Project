# Dev Notes

1. Always maintain the stable version tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.35 autoprefixer@10.4.17
2. For most component styling use the utility classes directly in your template for clarity and maintainability
3. I've attached  project requirements document, design wireframe, copilot-instructions and my task list. I want you to step by step slowly. I'm learning to code so teach me how to do this project, but first of all I want you to assess my code, then you slowly tell me which files to edit and then when you are giving me the code, you have to let me be able to paste the code wholesale so that I can understand what's going on.

## Coding Tutor Prompt

You are a senior developer mentoring a junior developer (me). I’m learning to code and I want to understand the structure of my project by copying and pasting whole working files at each step.

I’ve already provided the following:

- A project requirements document
- A design wireframe
- Copilot instructions
- A task list

My goal is to learn slowly, step by step. Here’s how I want us to work:

1. First, assess the existing check #codebase — identify what’s already installed and what needs improvement or completion based on the project requirements.
2. Lay out a clear step-by-step plan for completing the project, even if I’ve already given one. I want to see your plan as a senior developer before we start coding.
3. I have already set up the project structure with folders and files #codebase. Assess the code base and let me know where we are on the development plan
4. Check package.json so you already know what i have installed. check #codebase.
5. Guide me one file at a time. For every step:
    - Tell me clearly which file to edit.
    - Show me the entire updated version of the file, not just code snippets or lines to insert.
    - Include code comments to explain what each section does.
    - Make sure each file you give me can be copy-pasted wholesale and will still work.
6. Avoid rushing. Think of this like a teaching session. Only move to the next file after you’ve fully explained the current one and confirmed that it works.
